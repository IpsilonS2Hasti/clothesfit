# ClothesFit
A mobile cross-platform application built with Flutter in the programming language Dart with serverless architecture powered by Firebase with the purpose of presenting an idea for a start-up competition (Teenovator 2022). The app has an onboarding screen which then intuitively leads the user to a screen where they need to take measurements with their camera and, keeping the phone level using an inclinometer I built using native device orientation in Flutter.
